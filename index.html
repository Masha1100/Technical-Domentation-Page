        <p>Welcome to Angular! Angular helps you build modern applications for the web, mobile, or desktop.</p>
        <p>This guide shows you how to build and run a simple Angular app. You'll use the Angular CLI tool to accelerate
        development, while adhering to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every Angular project.</p>
        <p>This guide takes less than 30 minutes to complete. At the end of this guide—as part of final code review—there is a
        link to download a copy of the final application code. (If you don't execute the commands in this guide, you can still
        download the final application code.)</p>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js® and an npm package manager.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Install the Angular CLI</h3>
            <p>You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing
            development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.</p>            
            <p>Install the Angular CLI globally.
            To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:
              <pre><code class="terminal-code">
              npm install -g @angular/cli
            </code></pre>
            </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Create a workspace and initial application</h3>
          <p>You develop apps in the context of an   Angular workspace. A workspace contains the   files for one or more projects. A
          project is the set of files that comprise an   app, a library, or end-to-end (e2e)   tests.</p>
          <p>To create a new workspace and initial app project:
            <ol>
              <li>Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:<pre><code class="terminal-code">
              ng new my-app
            </code></pre></li>
              <li>The<code> ng new </code>command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the defaults by
              pressing the Enter or Return key.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.
          It also creates the following workspace and starter project files:
            <ul>
              <li>A new workspace, with a root folder named my-app</li>
              <li>An initial skeleton app project, also called my-app (in the src subfolder)</li>
              <li>An end-to-end test project (in the e2e subfolder)</li>
              <li>Related configuration files</li></ul>
          </p>
          <p>
              The initial app project contains a simple Welcome app, ready to run
          </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Serve the application</h3>
          <p>Angular includes a server, so that you can easily build and serve your app locally.
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the workspace folder (my-app).</li>
              <li>Launch the server by using the CLI command ng serve, with the --open option.</li>
              <pre><code class="terminal-code">
                cd my-app
                ng serve --open
              </code></pre>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
          
          The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.
          </p>
          <p>Your app greets you with a message:</p>

        <p>The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Angular.
        In this tutorial you will build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.</p>
        <p>This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a
        list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.</p>
        <p>By the end of the tutorial you will be able to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.</li>
              <li>Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.</li>
              <li>Use one-way data binding for read-only data.</li>
              <li>Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.</li>
              <li>Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.</li>
              <li>Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.</li>
              <li>Format data with pipes.</li>
              <li>Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.</li>
              <li>Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>You'll learn enough Angular to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do.
          </p>
          <p>After completing all tutorial steps, the final app will look like this live example / download example.</p>

      <p>Here's a visual idea of where this tutorial leads, beginning with the "Dashboard" view and the most heroic heroes:</p>
      <div><img src="src/heroes-dashboard-1.png" alt="heroes dashboard"></div>
      <p>You can click the two links above the dashboard ("Dashboard" and "Heroes") to navigate between this Dashboard view and
      a Heroes view.</p>
      <p>If you click the dashboard hero "Magneta," the router opens a "Hero Details" view where you can change the hero's name.</p>
      <div><img src="src/hero-details-1.png" alt="hero details"></div>
      <p>Clicking the "Back" button returns you to the Dashboard. Links at the top take you to either of the main views. If you
      click "Heroes," the app displays the "Heroes" master list view.</p>
      <div><img src="src/heroes-list-2.png" alt="heroes list"></div>
      <p>After completing all tutorial steps, the final app will look like this live example / download example.</p>
      <p>When you click a different hero name, the read-only mini detail beneath the list reflects the new choice.</p>
      <p>You can click the "View Details" button to drill into the editable details of the selected hero.</p>
      <p>The following diagram captures all of the navigation options.</p>

        <p>You begin by creating an initial application using the Angular CLI. Throughout this tutorial, you’ll modify and extend that starter application to create the Tour of Heroes app.</p>
        <p>In this part of the tutorial, you'll do the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Set up your environment.</li>
          <li>Create a new workspace and initial app project.</li>
          <li>Serve the application.</li>
          <li>Make changes to the application.</li>

        <p>You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace. A workspace contains the files for one or more projects. A
        project is the set of files that comprise an app, a library, or end-to-end (e2e) tests. For this tutorial, you will
        create a new workspace.</p>
        <p>To create a new workspace and an initial app project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ensure that you are not already in an Angular workspace folder. For example, if you have previously created the Getting
          Started workspace, change to the parent of that folder.</li>
          <li>Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name <code> angular-tour-of-heroes </code>, as shown here:
            <pre><code class="terminal-code">
              ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
            </code></pre>

          <li>The <code> ng new </code>command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app project. Accept the

          </li>
          <li>An end-to-end test project (in the e2e subfolder).</li>
          <li>Related configuration files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The initial app project contains a simple Welcome app, ready to run.</p>
